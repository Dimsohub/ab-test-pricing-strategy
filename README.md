# A/B Test: Subscription Pricing with Discount Message

The goal of this A/B test is to determine whether offering a 50% discount message alongside the $4.99 subscription price (Group
B) has a statistically significant impact on the install-to-payment conversion rate compared to offering the standard $4.99 price
without a discount message (Group A).
